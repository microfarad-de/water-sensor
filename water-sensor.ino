/*
 * Water Level Sensor Adapter
 *
 * The water level sensor adapter enables the use of the CBE PT622 digital display panel with
 * third party resistive water level sensors.
 *
 * This sketch has been implemented and tested on an ATMega328P based Arduino Pro Mini
 * compatible board running on 3.3V/8MHz.
 *
 * It is recommended to activate the watchdog support on the Arduino bootloader
 * by defining the WATCHDOG_MODS macro. This will reduce the bootloader's power-up
 * delay, thus invalidating the need to hold the power button for around 2 seconds for
 * the system to turn on.
